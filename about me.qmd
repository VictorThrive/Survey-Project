I am a Statistician currently interning at ARM holding company as an `Investment Operation Analyst`. I have extensive background in statistics and working with varied data sets and using analytics to enable business stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using Reticulate, and data visualizations using ggplot, animation and interactivity. I am passionate about Love, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and lead actionable initiatives and conversations to drive inclusiveness within the data world.
