    "section": "",
    "text": "Depression prevalence varies among undergraduate students of different countries and cultures and is influenced by socio-demographics, interpersonal, intra-personal and environmental factors. This study aim to understand the state of depression and its effect on FUNAAB student’s academic performance.\n\nThe aim of this work is to explore the level of depression among undergraduates and its effect on their academic performance and also provide a simple guide on how to develop and use R shiny and Quarto application. Specifically, we aim to investigate:\n\nThe amount and causes of depression\nThe most significant factor using E.F.A and its effect on academic performance\nCheck the effect of depression, sex and gender on academic performance with ordinal Logistic regression\nBuild an interactive website using Quarto and R shiny to predict student academic performance and also educate the university community and the world.\n\n\n\nOne of the three specialized Universities of Agriculture in Nigeria. It was established on January 1, 1988 with the triple mandate of teaching, research and extension (knowledge and technology transfer). Its covers a total land Area of about 10,000 hectares located in Odeda Local Government Abeokuta, Capital of Ogun State, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA depression assssment questionaire was designed with Google forms and was distributed via social media to different college students, student leaders and unions, a total of 246 response was received, the data was stratified by gender and sample size of 100 was randomly selected. The information contained in the data includes socio demographic information, cgp, cgpa, sex, stress score, stress level e.t.c.\n\nWe begin by loading the raw data into R and performing some pre processing steps to prepare the data for analysis. First, we rename columns in the data set using the rename() function. Then, we reverse code likert items, convert columns to appropriate data types and other necessary data engineering techniques was applied before writing the clean data to file in a c.s.v. format.

This helps to describe the data and identify underlying factors, this is the first step used to explore and reduce the number of variables into three group of factors namely interpersonal factor, interpersonal factor and environmental factor. \n\nAn ordered logistic regression model was employed to examine the relationship between students’ G.P.A and several factors, including gender, depression level, interpersonal factors, and environmental stress. Prior to analyzing the data, we loaded the necessary packages and imported the dataset. Next, we redefined the levels of the categorical factors. To ensure randomness, we created a randomized copy of the data and drew a sample of 100 males and 100 females. Subsequently, we combined the two samples into a single dataset. From this combined dataset, we selected the variables of interest. To assess model performance, we split the data into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data). The model was trained using the training set, and its performance was evaluated using the test set.\n\nCode#|echo: false\n#| output: false\n#| warning: false\n#| eval: false\n\n\n# Load the necessary packages \nmy_packages <-c(\"ordinal\",\"tidyverse\",\"caTools\",\"MASS\",\"brant\",\"Metrics\",\"gtable\",\"skimr\")\nlapply(my_packages, require, character.only = TRUE)\n\nLoading required package: caTools\n\n\nWarning: package 'caTools' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\nLoading required package: Metrics\n\n\nWarning: package 'Metrics' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'Metrics'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:rcompanion':\n\n    accuracy\n\n\nLoading required package: gtable\n\n\nWarning: package 'gtable' was built under R version 4.2.3\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[2]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[3]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[4]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[5]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[6]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[7]]\n[1] TRUE\n\n[[8]]\n[1] TRUE\n\nCode# Import data \nordiDf <- read.csv(\"dataset/Ordinal.csv\",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\n# prepare a randomize copy of the data\nordiDf <- ordiDf[sample(nrow(ordiDf)), ]\n\n# defiined factor levels\nordiDf$f2 <- factor(ordiDf$f2,levels = c(\"Not Applicable\",\n                                         \"Strongly Agree\",\n                                         \"Agree\",\"Neutral\",\n                                         \"Disagree\",\n                                         \"Strongly Disagree\"), ordered = TRUE)\n\nordiDf$f3 <- factor(ordiDf$f3,levels = c(\"Not Applicable\",\n                                         \"Strongly Agree\",\n                                         \"Agree\",\"Neutral\",\n                                         \"Disagree\",\n                                         \"Strongly Disagree\"), ordered = TRUE)\n\nordiDf$f1 <- factor(ordiDf$f1,levels = c(\"Not Applicable\",\n                                         \"Strongly Agree\",\n                                         \"Agree\",\"Neutral\",\n                                         \"Disagree\",\n                                         \"Strongly Disagree\"), ordered = TRUE)\n\n# Draw 100 samples each of male and female\nmale_samples <- ordiDf %>%\n  filter(gender == \"Male\") %>%\n  sample_n(90, replace = FALSE)\n\nfemale_samples <- ordiDf %>%\n  filter(gender == \"Female\") %>%\n  sample_n(90, replace = FALSE)\n\n# Combine the male and female samples\ncombined_samples <- rbind(male_samples, female_samples)\n\n# prepare a randomize copy of the data\ncombined_samples <- combined_samples[sample(nrow(combined_samples)), ]\n\n# Print the combined samples\nView(combined_samples)\nnew_sample <- combined_samples[,-c(1,2)]\n\nnew_sample <- dplyr::select(new_sample,gender,C.G.P,stress,f1,f2,f3)\n\nView(new_sample)\n\n#Splitting the data\nsplit = sample.split(new_sample$C.G.P, SplitRatio = 0.8)\ntrain_set = subset(new_sample, split == TRUE)\ntest_set = subset(new_sample, split == FALSE)\n\n#Write new files for the train and test sets\nwrite.csv(train_set, \"train.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\nwrite.csv(test_set, \"test.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n# test of goodness\n#chisq.test(df$C.G.P,unlist(predict(model1))\n\n#Ordinal Logistic Regression\n#model\nmodel <- clm(C.G.P ~  ., data = train_set, link = \"logit\")\n\n\n# Performance Metrics\n\n# Predicting the test values\ny_pred_m <- predict(model, newdata = test_set, type = \"class\")\nctab <- table(y_pred_m$fit, test_set$C.G.P)\n# correctly classified predictions\n(CCR <- sum(diag(ctab)) / sum(ctab))\n\n[1] 0.5555556\n\nCode# mean prediction error (proportion of mismatched predictions based on the C.G.P in the train set)\n mpe <-mean(as.character(test_set$C.G.P) != as.character(y_pred_m$fit))\n \n \n #Saving the model\nsaveRDS(model, file = \"./model.rda\")\n# Save the CCR\nsaveRDS(CCR, file = \"./CCR.rda\")\n# Save the mpe\nsaveRDS(mpe, file = \"./mpe.rda\")\n\n\n\nThe results of the model suggest that gender does not have a statistically significant impact on students’ G.P.A, as indicated by the coefficient estimate for genderMale (-0.215584, p-value: 0.5408). Among the stress levels, only stressMild showed a marginally significant negative association with G.P.A, with an estimated coefficient of -0.911112 (p-value: 0.1004).\nThe threshold coefficients represent the cutoff points that differentiate different classes of G.P.A. For instance, the threshold between “First class” and “Second class” is estimated to be -2.3383, while the threshold between “Second class” and “Second class lower” is 0.4869. Additionally, the threshold between “Second class lower” and “Third class” is estimated to be 4.1911.\nHere is an interpretation of the effect of each predictor based on the provided coefficient estimates:\n\ngenderMale: The coefficient estimate of -0.215584 suggests that being male is associated with a slight decrease in the odds of having a higher C.G.P, but the effect is not statistically significant (p-value: 0.5408). In other words, gender does not have a significant impact on the students’ G.P.A.\nstressMild: The coefficient estimate of -0.911112 indicates that experiencing mild stress is associated with a decrease in the odds of having a higher C.G.P. However, the effect is only marginally significant (p-value: 0.1004), suggesting that the relationship between mild stress and G.P.A needs further investigation.\nstressModerate: The coefficient estimate of -0.153460 suggests that moderate stress does not have a significant impact on students’ G.P.A, as the effect is not statistically significant (p-value: 0.7855).\nstressSerious: The coefficient estimate of 0.418785 indicates that experiencing serious stress does not have a statistically significant effect on students’ G.P.A (p-value: 0.4744).\nstressVery little: The coefficient estimate of -0.207082 suggests that experiencing very little stress does not have a significant impact on G.P.A, as the effect is not statistically significant (p-value: 0.7320).\nf1, f2, f3 (categorical factors): The coefficient estimates for the different levels of these factors (f1.L, f1.Q, f1.C, f1^4, f1^5, f2.L, f2.Q, f2.C, f2^4, f3.L, f3.Q, f3.C, f3^4, f3^5) indicate the relationship between each level of the factors and G.P.A. However, none of these coefficients are statistically significant, suggesting that these factors do not have a significant impact on G.P.A. and may need further investigation.\n\nOverall, the coefficient estimates provide insights into the relationships between the predictor variables (stress and gender) and the log-odds of the ordinal response variable (C.G.P). However, it’s important to consider statistical significance when interpreting the coefficients. In this case, the p-value is 0.2235, suggesting that the difference is not statistically significant at a conventional significance level (e.g., 0.05).\nHowever several model was trained with different factors combinations and their prediction performance record as below\n\nmodel1 with f1, f2 and f3 predicts 50% C.G.P correctly\nmodel2 with stress predict 41% C.G.P correctly\nmodel3 with f1, f2 ,f3 and stress predicts C.G.P 41% correctly\nmodel4 with f1, f2 ,f3, stress and gender predicts C.G.P 41% correctly\nmodel5with f1, f2 ,f3 and gender predicts 47% C.G.P correctly\nmodel6 with f2 predict 48% C.G.P correctly\nmodel7 with f1 predicts 41% C.G.P correctly\nmodel8 with f3 predicts 47% C.G.P correctly\nThe best model in this case is model 1 with 0.5 error classification rate\n\nThis finding supports the notion that model1 captures important patterns and dependencies between the predictor variables and the response variable also having the least prediction error rate which indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no association. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant relationship between the observed and predicted values of the response variable.\nWe also see that the study reveals the following\n\n\nStress Levels:\n\nIndividuals with a mild stress level have lower odds of the response variable compared to the reference category.\nModerate and very little stress levels do not show significant evidence of a difference in odds.\nIndividuals with a serious stress level have slightly higher odds of the response variable, although not statistically significant.\n\n\n\nGender:\n\nBeing male is associated with slightly lower odds of the response variable, but it is not statistically significant.\n\n\n\nThresholds:\n\nThe odds of transitioning from the first class to the second class are very low.\nThe odds of transitioning from the second class to the second class lower are relatively high.\nThe odds of transitioning from the second class lower to the third class are significantly higher.\n\n\n\n\nShiny is an R package that makes it easy to build Interactive web applications (apps) straight from R without using any web application language such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.\nTo install the R package, open an R session, connect to the internet and run.\ninstall.packages(\"shiny\")\nShiny apps are contained in a single script called app.R.

    "text": "Depression is a serious mental health issue that affects millions of people around the world. As a final year student at Federal University of Agriculture, I was interested in exploring how depression affects academic performance, so I conducted a research project using R. In this Shiny website, I will share my findings and personal experience with depression.\n\nAs a student who has struggled with depression, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to focus on school work when you’re feeling down. There were times when I found it hard to motivate myself to attend classes, complete assignments, and study for exams, so I started getting curious and asking questions.\nPrevious research has shown that depression is a serious health concern for the student population (Ibrahim et al 2013), and it has a notable impact on academic performance with depressed students achieving lower grades and being less active in the classroom than their non depressed peers (Wechslr et al 2000). Students who are depressed may have difficulty concentrating, staying motivated, and retaining information. They may also be more likely to miss classes, turn in assignments late, or drop out of school. These negative effects can have long-term consequences for students’ academic and career success.\nDepression and its impact on academic performance is a complex and important issue that deserves more attention. Currently there is a limited availability of stand alone websites dedicated to sharing insights in Nigeria, by introducing and leveraging the features and capabilities of Quarto webistes to the development of effective knowledge-sharing platforms and ultimately foster collaboration, accessibility and insights across different domain in Nigeria. I hope to raise awareness of this issue and encourage others to take action and also adopt the use of R Shiny and Quarto to bridge the existing gap in dedicated websites for sharing their scientific research insights with others across the world.\nI recommends the adoption of R Shiny and Quarto as a tool for teaching and learning applied statistics at all tertiary levels.
