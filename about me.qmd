I am a bilingual statistical programmer currently working at ARM holding company as an **Investment Operation Analyst** (Intern). I have Bachelor of Science degree in statistics and working with varied data sets and using analytics to enable business stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using Reticulate, and data visualizations using ggplot, animation and interactivity. My passion lies in utilizing data to solve real-world problems and empower people to make well-informed decisions based on accurate facts and figures.
